<p> I love my dog and so one day I decided to challenge myself by embroidering (a new found skill at the time) my favourite photo of my dog Izzie.
The finished product was more inspired than I was expecting and it seemed to gain the attention of my friends and family.<br>
Later that week I had a request for an embroidered photo for a friends Christmas present, I absolutely adored the finished product!
The gift brought a tear to it’s receivers’ eye once opened and it was then I knew I had created something special!<br>
I love pets of all shapes and sizes so I’m very grateful that I can create these very personal gifts that people can cherish.
